# Cuda aware MPI

## Compute capability

* **CUDA-aware MPI for Compute Capability >= 2.0** and CUDA 4.0, due to the Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA) feature
	* GPUDirect RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) since CUDA 5.0 
	* GPUDirect P2P (Peer-to-Peer) since CUDA 4.0
	* GPUDirect for accelerated communication with network and storage devices since CUDA 3.1
