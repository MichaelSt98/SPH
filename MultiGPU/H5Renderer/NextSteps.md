# Next steps

## Finishing SPH Extension

* introduce relevant quantities for SPH
	* pressure
	* density
* implement a simple kernel
* implement a simple EOS
* call the nearest neighbour search locally
	* including the received particles


## General

* clean/refactor code
* time kernels
	* find most expensive functions/kernels


## Regarding MilupHPC

* how to generalize functionalities
* how to structure
